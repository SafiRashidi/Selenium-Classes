approach to select the check box single

1.inspect the checkbox
2.write down the correct locator in the DOM
3. use find Element  the find the check Box
4.click on it


If I want to check that check box is selected or not?
  checkbox.isSelected();---> TRUE (means selected)

Preferred Approach when it comes to multiple checkboxes
1.inspect them in the DOM
2. write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes
3. use find Elements to get all those checkboxes
4.iterate through the list
5. while iteration look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides u the indication that this
is your desired checkbox)
6. if condition to make the selection

Drop Down:

Two types:
1. Single select
2.Multi select
-------------

When it comes to drop Down we have a class in selenium that help us interact with them

------->Select class;---> in order to be able to use this class your drop down must be made in the DOM using the SELECT tag

Single Select Drop Down--->
Approach:
1.inspect the Drop Down
2.Check if it has the select tag
3. Write down the locator to find the WebElement drop down
4. Declare an object of the select class (pass the Web Element in the parameters)
5. use methods from select class to select the desired option.
---> SelectByVisibleText();
        byValue();
        byIndex();


Multi Select Drop Down--->

Approach:

1.Inspect the DropDown
2.Check if it has the select tag
3. Write down the locator to find the WEbElment drop down
4.Declare an object of the select class (pass the Web Element in the parameters)
5. use methods to select the desired  option:
selectByVisibleText();
selectByValue();
selectByIndex();
You can also use deselect methods in case of a multi-select dropdown.
To check if the dropdown is multi-select or not, you can use the isMultiple() method, which returns a boolean true if it is a multi-select dropdown.
Note: Indexing starts from 0 if the first option is not disabled, and indexing starts from 1 if the first option is disabled.

---------------------Alerts------------------------------

Alerts are the popup windows that appear and without dealing with them, you cannot proceed with doing anything else. You cannot inspect them.

Three types of alerts:

JavaScript alerts --> using SwitchTo commands.
HTML-based alerts/popups --> we can deal with them like other WebElements.
Window-based --> we cannot deal with them using Selenium.
JavaScript alerts:

Simple alert.
Confirmation alert.
Prompt alert.
You deal with all of them in the exact same way.

--------------------------Switch To Window--------------------------------------

Every time you open a new window, there is a unique handle attached to it, which is a unique code.

.getWindowHandle(): Returns the handle for the current window on which the focus is.
.getWindowHandles(): Returns the window handles of all the opened windows in a set of strings.
It is a set because the driver doesn't know which window opened up first.
