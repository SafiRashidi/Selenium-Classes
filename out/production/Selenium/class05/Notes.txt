approach to select the check box single

1.inspect the checkbox
2.write down the correct locator in the DOM
3. use find Element  the find the check Box
4.click on it


If I want to check that check box is selected or not?
  checkbox.isSelected();---> TRUE (means selected)

Preferred Approach when it comes to multiple checkboxes

1.inspect them in the DOM
2. write the locator in such a way that it is able to select all the required checkboxes
3. use find Elements to get all those checkboxes
4.iterate through the list
5. while iteration look for your desired checkbox (inspect the DOM to see which information provides u the indication that this
is your desired checkbox)
6. if condition to make the selection
